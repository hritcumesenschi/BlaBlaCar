# BlaBlaCar
Welcome to the Bla Bla Car project. This personal programming endeavor aims to replicate an experience similar to the actual Bla Bla Car website. Users will have the ability to perform actions such as logging in, logging out, registering, and reserving trips. The project is structured using the MVC architecture as follows:

  The Model folder encompasses classes necessary for defining SQL tables.
  Within the View folder, you'll find all the view files generated as direct responses from the functions within the Controller folder.

## Website Presentation

To better understand the project, I have inserted some screenshots from the website. 
Before you log in, you can search the trips available to reserve. However, you have to be logged in to Propose a Trip, Reserve a Trip or see the your Reserved Trips.
## Registration Form
  Since we don't have an account, we will create one to log in.

## Technologies Used:
The  project incorporates SQL, a standard language for interacting with relational databases, to provide real-time access to data stored in the backend database. SQL functions are employed within the project to execute queries and retrieve information from the database tables.

1. AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
   - Utilized AJAX for asynchronous data retrieval and dynamic content updating without page reloads. This enhances user experience by providing seamless interactions.

2. Doctrine:
   - Employed Doctrine, an ORM library for PHP, for simplified database access. Doctrine abstracts database interactions, allowing manipulation of PHP objects instead of raw SQL queries.

3. Form Processing:
   - Implemented form processing to handle user input from HTML forms. This involves validating, processing, and storing form data in the database. 


These technologies collectively enable the development of interactive and dynamic web applications, enhancing usability and efficiency.
