# BlaBlaCar
Welcome to the Bla Bla Car project. This personal programming endeavor aims to replicate an experience similar to the actual Bla Bla Car website. Users will have the ability to perform actions such as logging in, logging out, registering, and reserving trips. The project is structured using the MVC architecture as follows:

  The Model folder encompasses classes necessary for defining SQL tables.
  Within the View folder, you'll find all the view files generated as direct responses from the functions within the Controller folder.
